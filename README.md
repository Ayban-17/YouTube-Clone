# YouTube-Clone


My YouTube clone app is a functional front-end web application that I developed using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I'm proud to say that it functions very well and I'm happy with the end result.

One of the key features of my app is the search functionality, which enables users to search for videos on the platform. To embed the videos on the page, I used the YouTube embed code, which was a straightforward process.

It's worth noting that the data displayed on the application is local data that I scraped myself. This means that the app doesn't rely on any external APIs or databases to function, and all the information displayed on the platform is self-contained within the application.

Overall, I'm really happy with how my YouTube clone app turned out. It offers users a seamless video browsing experience with a simple and intuitive user interface, and I'm confident that others will enjoy using it as much as I do.
